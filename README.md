# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This folder centralizes our processes, templates, and decision records to make delivery predictable, transparent, and easy for new teammates to adopt.

OctoAcme runs projects through a structured lifecycle: initiation (one‑pagers to capture problem, goal, and stakeholders), planning (breakdown into a prioritized backlog, estimates, and a Definition of Done), execution (project board with Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done and a PR-driven workflow), release (typed releases with pre-release checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans), and retrospective (timeboxed reviews that convert action items into backlog tasks). Roles are explicit — Product Managers define outcomes and success metrics, Project Managers coordinate schedules and risks, Developers deliver and test, and QA validates acceptance criteria — with named PM and Product Lead ownership for each project.

Communication is regular and intentional: daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs and PM+PdM check‑ins, demos at milestone boundaries, and monthly stakeholder updates. A single source of truth (the project README or release document) and a weekly status template keep stakeholders aligned. Blockers escalate via a clear path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and incident communications follow a playbook for rapid response.

Quality and risk management are integrated into day‑to‑day work: CI runs unit/integration tests and security scans, small PRs include acceptance criteria and require at least one approval, critical flows have end‑to‑end smoke tests, and manual QA is used for acceptance when needed. Risks are tracked in a risk register and reviewed regularly; retrospectives capture improvements and convert them into actionable backlog items.
