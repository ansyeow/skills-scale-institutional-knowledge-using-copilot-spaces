## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme uses a structured approach with the following phases and artifacts:

- **Initiation:** Define problem, stakeholders, goals, and alignment (see Project Initiation Guide)
- **Planning:** Break down work, estimate, identify risks and dependencies, and prepare a backlog (see Project Planning)
- **Execution:** Track delivery via project boards, regular standups, and reporting; ensure quality through reviews and testing (see Execution & Tracking Guide)
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardize how features are released, deploy via pipelines, and document release notes and rollback plans (see Release & Deployment Guide)
- **Risk Management:** Ongoing risk and dependency tracking, clear escalation paths, and consistent stakeholder communication (see Risk Management & Communication)
- **Retrospectives:** Continuous improvement via regular retrospectives and action items (see Retrospective & Continuous Improvement)
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** Clear role definitions for PM, PdM, Developers, Tech Lead, QA, UX/UI Designer, Business Analyst, Support Engineers, and Stakeholders (see Roles & Personas)
